<b>How it works: </b>The user will use a form and enter NASDAQ stocks they're interested in. Next, VBA code will then pull historical data from google finance and insert it to an access database. Finally, the tool will predict the stocks next day's closing price using an artifical neural network with 5 hidden layers. The investment recommendation will be saved in the database and a word report is generated with the predictions for the user.
